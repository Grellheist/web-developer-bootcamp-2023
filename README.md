# The Webdeveloper Bootcamp 2023

This repository will contain every project developed during <a
href=https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/>The Web Developer
Bootcamp 2023</a> course on Udemy.

The repository starts on Section 3 because the earlier sections were only
introductory/theory.

From Section 3 to Section 5, the codes will be written with HTML <b>only</b>.

I will try completing one Section per day but my highest priority right now it
the <a href=https://github.com/Grellheist/100-days-of-python>100 days of Python
repo</a>.
