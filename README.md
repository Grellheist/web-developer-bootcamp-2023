# The Webdeveloper Bootcamp 2023

This repository will contain every project developed during <a
href=https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/>The Web Developer
Bootcamp 2023</a> course on Udemy.

The repository starts on Section 3 because the earlier sections were only
introductory/theory.

## HTML
From Section 3 to Section 5, the codes will be written with HTML <b>only</b>.

## CSS
From Section 6 onwards, the codes will be written with the addition of CSS
(finally lol).

## Bootstrap
From Section 12 onwards, the codes may (there are other frameworks that will
be used in the bootcamp) be written using Bootstrap instead of plain CSS.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is going to be present from section 14 onwards. For the JS content I
will mostly only keep the files as a cheat sheet to learn the syntax for the
language.

## DOM
The DOM is introduced in Section 24.

## Advanced JS concepts
This folder goes through a lot of concepts, like Async JS and promises, AJAX,
APIs, Prototypes, Classes and OOP.

## Backend
The backend section starts on Section 30, which introduces the terminal (which
I'm quite familiar with) and has no coding content.

After Section 30, the course introduces NodeJS.

## Express
Express will be used from Section 33 onwards.

## MongoDB
The Database that is being used for this course is MongoDB.

## YelpCamp
THE main and final project of the course. I will try my best to do most of the
requirements by myself before watching the videos.

## Disclaimer
I will try completing one Section per day but my highest priority right now is
the <a href=https://github.com/Grellheist/100-days-of-python>100 days of Python
repo</a>.

Also, I will still do the basic stuff to get a sense of continuity from the
course (I've learned most of the HTML/CSS sections on FreeCodeCamp).

# Feedback & Updates
I've really enjoyed the course and all it does provide. It is great value if
you get it while on sale.

However, there ARE a few things I dislike about it. I heavily dislike the usage
of MongoDB in this course. Although MongoDB CAN be used in some cases, it
should not be used in the case of this project. Any SQL db would do a better
job here (Also my MongoDB installation broke, so it makes me dislike it even
more lol).

Also, I don't really like the usage of ejs for the html stuff, but that's
mostly because I don't like the syntax.

All in all, would rate it 75/100, and I definitely recommend the purchase.
