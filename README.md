# The Webdeveloper Bootcamp 2023

This repository will contain every project developed during <a
href=https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/>The Web Developer
Bootcamp 2023</a> course on Udemy.

The repository starts on Section 3 because the earlier sections were only
introductory/theory.

## HTML
From Section 3 to Section 5, the codes will be written with HTML <b>only</b>.

## CSS
From Section 6 onwards, the codes will be written with the addition of CSS
(finally lol).

## Bootstrap
From Section 12 onwards, the codes may (there are other frameworks that will
be used in the bootcamp) be written using Bootstrap instead of plain CSS.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is going to be present from section 14 onwards. For the JS content I
will mostly only keep the files as a cheat sheet to learn the syntax for the
language.

## DOM
The DOM is introduced in Section 24.

## Advanced JS concepts
This folder goes through a lot of concepts, like Async JS and promises, AJAX,
APIs, Prototypes, Classes and OOP.

## Backend
The backend section starts on Section 30, which introduces the terminal (which
I'm quite familiar with) and has no coding content.

After Section 30, the course introduces NodeJS.

## Express
Express will be used from Section 33 onwards.

## MongoDB
The Database that is being used for this course is MongoDB.

## Disclaimer
I will try completing one Section per day but my highest priority right now is
the <a href=https://github.com/Grellheist/100-days-of-python>100 days of Python
repo</a>.

Also, I will still do the basic stuff to get a sense of continuity from the
course (I've learned most of the HTML/CSS sections on FreeCodeCamp).
